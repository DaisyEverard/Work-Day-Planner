## Description

A day planner with a timeblock for each work hour from 9-5. In each block you can enter an event and have it stored on your local computer.

- Current Time and Date display at top of page
- If hour block it current, it display as red. If in the past, it's grey. In the future, it's green. 
- Up to 5 events can be stored in each timeslot. Exceeding this, an alert informs the user. 
- Events have red buttons next to them to delete the event. If duplicate events are added to the same timeslot, clicking delete on one will delete all instances of the event.
